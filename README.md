# Personal-Website-Template
**A professional, fully functioning personal website**

To host your new personal website, create an account at [Github](https://www.github.com). Then, create a new repository and call it "Personal Website". Either upload the code by committing it from your code editor, or simply upload the files. 

Now that your project is online, go to the "Settings" tab and then the "Pages" tab. Finally, switch the Source from "none" to "main", and click "save". Wait a couple of minutes while it says "Your site is ready to be published", and refresh the page. Once the above box turns green and indicates that your site has been published, you are 100% done. Congrats on your new personal website!

If you want to host the website using a **different method**, that is completely fine. However, if you have never done so, I would suggest Github pages since it is easy and free.

### Future updates
Go follow [Rosacodes](https://www.instagram.com/rosacodes) on Instagram in order to see any future updates. New sections will be added in the future, so tag along for that!

### Closing
I hope that you find this project useful. Please let me know if you have any questions. You can find me at @rosacodes on Instagram, or by sending an email to dev@rosacodes.com. 

Also, please let me know if you actually do end up using this project, I would love to see your new website!

Just a little note, I won't be bug solving for anybody. You are getting the website in a fully working state, so as long as you follow the above instructions you should be just fine.
